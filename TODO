usability
- specify dims by tilewidth, tileheight, tiledims, or maxtiles
- multithreading
- user mode switching, unified paths, report tiler used
- save results for easy re-renders (fuzz, etc)
- light profiling for any easy wins?

output quality
- separate backgrounds for source, tiles
- fuzz/variety-boosting:
  - penalize overrepresented tiles (replacing some proportion w/ next-best/nearest alt)
- exclude skin-tone modifiers?
- experiment with overbleed matching (measure flip-diff in source img surroundings) 


fun
- limit emojis by unicode version
- exclude emojis (by user list or some predefined classes)
- limit to emojis (by user list or predefined classes)
- animated rendering?
  - check one emoji against all spots (rather than every emoji against spot-at-time)
  - cursor-addressing to roll in place as best improves
- histogram/graphic-equalizer UI
  - rise/low individual emoji weights
  - clip by unicode version, etc

distribution
- attribute flip code
- README/docs
